*Crossword puzzles with F#*

Fwords provides a clean, intuitive interface for solving (and authoring!) crosswords on desktop.

## Scope/Planning
1. fwords will include a 'solver' view(s) allowing users to interact with an in-progress puzzle and clues.
2. fwords will include a 'menu' view(s) allowing users to select from a list of available puzzles.
3. fwords will include an 'author' view(s) allowing users to edit the grid, clues, and solutions of a new puzzle.
4. fwords will include a 'settings' view(s) allowing users to change various game settings.
5. fwords will run and be developed on both Windows and Mac using .NET Core.
6. fwords will be written in F# as much as possible (the whole point of this thing is to try out F#).
7. fwords will be "singleplayer" for now, but we have plans to make a web-based one next!
